    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Blogging is old-school now! You can create channels on Youtube, Instagram stories, podcasts, you can live stream on Twitch, Clubhouse, you can even write paid newsletters on Substack! But&hellip; I like retro things&hellip;</p>
<p>For my blog revival, I explored different tools to create and maintain a blog. Many solutions are available for developers and DIY persons.</p>
<p>Today, my total cost to get my blog up and running is free. I just need to pay for a domain name and I found one super cheap at $3 per month because it has a strange extension: .co.</p>
<p>To start a blog you need 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a domain name (namecheap.com, domain.com, godaddy.com)</li>
<li>a host: where you store your website (Github pages, AWS, Notion, Ghost)</li>
<li>a technology: how you build your pages (Hugo, Jekyll, no-code)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-use-a-domain-name">Why use a domain name?</h3>
<ul>
<li>To get all the hard-won traffic and SEO associated with your own domain name.</li>
<li>To not confuse your audience with different domains.</li>
<li>No hidden advertisement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="no-code-with-notion">No code with Notion</h3>
<p>Without any hesitations, I would recommend to people with no code experience to consider Notion for their blogging platform.</p>
<p>Notion offers a no-code solution to publish webpages. For $5 per site per month, you can get your blog on your own domain name. This is a great way to start and you can focus on creating quality content regularly.</p>
<p>A minimalist personal website: <a href="https://mariohayashi.com">https://mariohayashi.com</a><br>
Another one: <a href="https://jodieloi.com">https://jodieloi.com</a></p>
<p>Total monthly cost of Notion: $4 (best case) for the domain name + $5 for Notion = <strong>$9 per month</strong></p>
<h3 id="no-code-with-ghost">No code with Ghost</h3>
<p>Ghost is THE alternative to WordPress: everything is better! It is lightning fast and safe. The integrated interface is great to manage content (CMS).</p>
<p>Ghost is a non-profit and they are trying to change the way we create and consume content. They are offering new ways to monetize content for serious bloggers: articles behind a paywall and paid newsletters. Writers can focus on creating content while readers can enjoy genuine content without hidden advertisements.</p>
<p>Total monthly cost of Ghost (no code): $4 for the domain name + $29 per month but there is no percentage taken on the paid subscriptions = <strong>$33 per month</strong></p>
<p>Ghost is open-source, so developers can use it on an external CDN. DigitalOcean has a pre-built ghost image set up that is working well for $5 per month and the simplest version of AWS Lightsail costs around $3.5 per month.</p>
<p>Total monthly cost of Ghost (developer edition): $4 for the domain name + around $4 for hosting = <strong>$8 per month</strong></p>
<h3 id="hugo-for-developers">Hugo (for developers)</h3>
<p>Hugo is the static website generator I used to create this blog. It is very light and minimalist.</p>
<p>I host my website on Github pages for free. Traffic is limited, so if my blog is too successful I would need to migrate my blog to AWS for example.</p>
<p>Total monthly cost of Hugo (developer edition): <strong>$4 per month</strong> for the domain name</p>
<p>Here is the ressource I used to set up my website: <a href="https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-gh/">https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-gh/</a></p>
<p>Every time I want to update my blog, I run the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo --theme lithium
cd public
git add *
git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Add a new post&#39;</span>
git push -u origin master
</code></pre></div><h3 id="jekyll-for-developers">Jekyll (for developers)</h3>
<p>Jekyll is very similar to Hugo, it is a free static website generator. Its main advantage is its integration with Github pages.</p>
<p>I decided to move from Jekyll to Hugo for non-rational reasons üë∏: Hugo seems lighter, cleaner and I found a theme in Hugo that I really like.</p>
<p>Total monthly cost of Jekyll (developer edition): <strong>$4 per month</strong> for the domain name</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope that this post will give you new ideas. When I did my research, I was surprised to read a lot of recommendations for outdated solutions! Of course, I have a lot of bias towards minimal, clean, DIY solutions for blogging, so keep that in mind when you read my post üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!</p>
